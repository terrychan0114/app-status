# Plant daily status update

## Overview
This server was generated by the [swagger-codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen) project. 

This repository serves as the daily update microservice for status on each plant. It links to a Excel spreadsheet that has 2 sheets named "NJ" and "VA". 

All the users need to do to update the status is to edit the speadsheet, this microservice will polls this sheet periodically to update the status. 
 
## Requirements
* Docker

## Start the server with Docker

To run the server on a Docker container, please execute the following from the root directory:

```
# building the image
docker build -t app-status .

# starting up a container
docker run -d -p 8083:8083 -v <directory of the excel file for the daily updates>:/usr/src/app/doc app-status
docker run -d -p 8083:8083 -v /C/Users/ENGINEERING-FLN1/Documents/Automation/Projects/software_ws/demo_shared_drive:/usr/src/app/doc hkserver/app-ciboard
```

## Regenerating server

Before regenerating the microservice, make sure you include the file that you **DON'T** want to delete in `.swagger-codegen-ignore`

To regenerate the microservice, you can run the following code:
```
java -jar ./swagger-codegen-cli.jar generate -i ./app-status/api/v1.0.0.yaml -l python-flask -c ./app-status/api/config.json -o ./app-status -Dmodels
java -jar ./swagger-codegen-cli.jar generate -i ./app-status/api/v1.0.0.yaml -l python-flask -c ./app-status/api/config.json -o ./app-status -Dapis
```
