# Plant daily status update

## Overview
This server was generated by the [swagger-codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen) project. 

This repository serves as the daily update microservice for status on each plant. It links to a Excel spreadsheet that has 2 sheets named "NJ" and "VA". 

All the users need to do to update the status is to edit the speadsheet, this microservice will polls this sheet periodically to update the status.
